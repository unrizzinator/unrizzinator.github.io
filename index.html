                <p>
                    My planned project as my final for my AP Economics class is going to be diving into EDC Las Vegas, 
                    a music festival hosted in Las Vegas where over 230 DJs perform concerts to more than a whopping 500,000 attendees. 
                    I chose this because I love the music that is in the EDM corner of the music world and I love the idea of going to a 
                    music festival with many of my favorite DJs performing there and jamming out to music with thousands and thousands of 
                    people who enjoy the same music as me. I'm also attending an EDM music festival in June that's similar to EDC Las Vegas. 
                    I plan on making a website and putting it on Github to make it accessible to anyone. The website will contain all 
                    information on my project. I can talk about merchandise sales and ticket sales as well as the impact on sales of certain goods. 
                    I could talk about pricing strategies of the tickets and merchandise. There's also revenue generated on some other 
                    companies due to externalities, and if the company who hosts it has monopolistic power. The ideas and models I can talk about are 
                    monopolies, externalities, incentives, scarcity, demand, opportunity costs, labor, competition, price determination, and production. 
                    Some models I can use are the PPC, Supply & Demand, Foreign Exchange, and Phillips curve.

                <h1 class="title">Concept 1: Monopolies</h1>
                <p>The exclusive possession or control of the supply of or trade in a commodity or service. It's basically when 1 company has complete control of the industry. In this case, Insomniac, the company that hosts EDC, is not the only company who hosts music festivals of this level.</p>

                <h1 class="title">Concept 2: Externalities</h1>
                <p>A side effect or consequences of an industrial or commercial activity that affects other parties without this being reflected in the cost of the goods or services involvd. Everytime when an EDC festival is hosted, there are externalities that exist/occur such as positive ones like economic stimulus and community building. Along with negative ones like noise pollution, environmental impact, traffic congestion, and strain on public services.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
                <h1 class="title">Concept 3: Incentives</h1>
                <p>Anything that persuades a person/organization to alter their behavior in the desired manner; Benefit or costs of an action that influence people's decisions and behavior. EDC Las Vegas and incentives go hand in hand becuase the staff encourage recycling your trash in exchange for cool rewards. So, by doing such thing, they can persuade the attendees into recycling their trash for rewards.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
                <h1 class="title">Concept 4: Scarcity</h1>
                <p>Scarcity is when demand for a good or service is greater than the availability of that good or service. At a music festival, scarcity exists almost everywhere. Some examples are the tickets for admittance, space/capacity at each stage, merchandise from all the artists, and the amount of bathrooms.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
                <h1 class="title">Concept 5: Demand</h1>
                <p>The quantity of a good that consumers are willing and able to purchase at various prices during a given time. EDC Las Vegas is hosted 3 days in a row at the same place, one time a year. The emand for tickets to attend are to have high demand every time.</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
                <h1 class="title">Concept 6: Opportunity Cost</h1>
                <p>The loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen. When you're going to a music festival like EDC Las Vegas, you can't see all artists at all stages in 3 days. So, you have to choose wisely who you will go see. For example, 3 DJs you like are playing right now at 3 different stages and you can only choose one of them to go see.</p>

                <h1 class="title">Concept 7: Labor</h1>
                <p>Labor is basically the work that people put in to produce a good or service. The amount of labor put in to producing a muysic festival for half a million conert-goers is mind boggling when looking at how they have to set all of the stages, sound, shops, decorations, lighting FX, music production, hire multiple companies, getting sponsors, and managing.</p>

                <h1 class="title">Concept 8: Competition</h1>
                <p>When other firms compete over price, product, promotion, and place. Some competitors to Insomniac (the company who hosts EDC) are Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp., VER, and Machine Shop. These competitors also host events like EDC and are considered competitors to Insomniac.</p>

                <h1 class="title">Concept 9: Price Determination</h1>
                <p>The process of how the forces of demand for goods and services and the supply of goods and services in a market interact to determine the price. This concept applies to EDC Las Vegas through the tickets, merchandise, food, beverages, and nearby hotels. Prices tend to go higher due to the high demand caused by a massive amount of people.</p>

                <h1 class="title">Concept 10: Production</h1>
                <p>Process by which a producer takes inputs, or factors of production and creates an output. Some inputs are the DJs, staff of shops and the event itself. Without them, there'd be no production at all.</p>
